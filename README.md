# MyToolbarJog

URCap sample that allows users to incrementally jog the robot in cartesian space through the toolbar. The URCap demonstrates how to:

1. Create a toolbar (as [MyToolbar](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/MyToolbar))
2. Connect to the Dashboard server of the robot through Java
3. Send script commands from a URCap to the robot over the primary client interface


## Information
This URCap has been developed using:
- URCap API version 1.12.0
- PolyScope version 5.12.4

Usage of the URCap on any other combination of software remains untested (will likely work however).
